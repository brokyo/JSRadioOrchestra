I've been learning all these little weird things and I just realized they're all sort of the same thing but from different angles. 

This is the (horrible) source code for a thing that's had a bunch of different forms. It's sort of an instrument? But it's called Our Little Planet? And even that might be a node on this weirder larger thing I'm trying to make? Dunno. My ideas outreach my talents by about a thousand miles.

If for some reason you find this interesting you can email me at alexcarusillo@gmail.com and I'd love to help our take feedback. This is all hosted at []


This codebase is a work in progress and I'm not a good engineer so don't try to make any sense of it
